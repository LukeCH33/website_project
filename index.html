 <h2 class="subheading">What is Paleontology?</h2>

 <p class="paragraph">Paleontology is the study of the history of life on Earth, via fossils. 
 Fossils are the remains of plants, animals, fungi, bacteria, and single-celled 
 living things that have been replaced by rock material or impressions of organisms 
 preserved in rock.aleontologists use fossil remains to understand different aspects of 
 extinct and living organisms. Individual fossils may contain information about an organism’s life
 and environment. Much like the rings of a tree, for example, each ring on the surface of an oyster
 shell denotes one year of its life. Studying oyster fossils can help paleontologists discover how long 
 the oyster lived, and in what conditions. If the climate was favorable for the oyster, the oyster probably 
 grew more quickly and the rings would be thicker. If the oyster struggled for survival, the rings would
 be thinner. Thinner rings would indicate an environment not favorable to organisms like the oyster,too
 warm or too cold for the oyster, for example, or lacking nutrients necessary for them to grow.
 Paleontologists use indictors like this in all fossils although it differs from species to species.

 <h2 class="subheading">why paleontology is important?</h2>

 <p class="paragraph">Paleontology is important because it allows us to know how 
 everything we know today evolved. we still dont know how life came to be on earth and
 why it came about in the first place but we know how millions of creatures evolved and
 many more have yet to be discovered. another reason paleontology is important is becasue
 without it biologists would not have features and characteristics to refer back to in the
 event a prehistoric feature appeared again.<p>
